An Infinite Shooter

Here's my first game for the Arduboy.
It's an infinite shoot em up where you need to catch all the love you can while dodging the angry faces coming at you!
This game is dedicated to my wife Jessica, i wanted my first game to be easy and cute for her to play on.

Game Features:

- Parralax scrolling
- HighScore saving (with a way to reset it by pressing B on title screen)
- Cute hearts all over the screen!
